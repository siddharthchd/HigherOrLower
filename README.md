# HigherOrLower

This simple app generates a random number between 1 and 10.

The user has to guess the number. If the users entered number is above or below the generated number, the app will toast a message to go lower or higher respectively.

If the user's number and the generated number are the same, the app toasts a message "That's Right" and then generates a new random number between 1 and 10 to continue with the game.
